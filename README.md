# Meditation Room API
This project is for my mom.
My mom is interested in Buddhism and Budhists(People who do Buddhism) do meditation.
My mom wanted me to create sign up/log in system for herself and her friends, she decided to do stuff like avatars, real-time text and you get my point.
So the day I wrote this we had a little fight(Me: Let's make app, My Mom: No website).
Either way, the API won't change anyways.
Sooo I'm gonna add to render.
render.yaml and requirements.txt are either meta data and (obviously) required modules.
